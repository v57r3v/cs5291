ESS   312 - Hydrogeology   Assignment   1
A   network   of   25 piezometers, including   atransect   of   7 multi-level   piezometers, was   installed in a unconfined sand aquifer to map and   evaluate   groundwater   flow between   a wetland   (Beaver Bog) and adjacent lake (Antelope Lake).    The   3.2   km2    study   area   corresponds to UTM   Eastings of   387000 to 388600 m and Northings of   5104000 to 5106000 m;   surface   elevations   and   surveyed coordinates for the positions of   the wetland and lake   shorelines   are   shown in   Table   1.   Piezometers locations and surface elevations are given   in   Table   2,   as well   as   corresponding   piezometer stick-up heights, installed screen elevations, and top-of-pipe measurements   for   depth   to water; auger refusal depths (i.e., assumed to be   depth to bedrock   from   ground   surface)   are   provided for the multi-level piezometers.
1.       Calculate the hydraulic head for each of   the single   and multi-level piezometers.      Report   results in a table.    Do not   show calculations.
2.       Complete a (hand drawn) areal   flownet diagram   (map)   for   groundwater   flow between   Beaver   Bog   and   Antelope   Lake.    Set   the   x   (east-west)   andy   (north-south)   axes   of   the   flownet   to   the   UTM   coordinates   of   3.2 km2    of   the   study   area.    The   scales   of   the   x   andy axes should be same.    Clearly indicate equipotential   lines   on the   flownet, using   1.0   m hydraulic head spacings, groundwater flow direction (arrows),   flow/no-flow/constant   head boundaries.
3.       Determine the distance between piezometers and calculate bedrock elevations along the      A4-T to B3-T transect of   multilevel piezometers.    Report results in a table.    Do not   show calculations.
4.       Complete a (hand drawn) cross-sectional flownet   diagram   (map)   for   groundwater   flow
along the A4-T to B3-T transect between Beaver Bog and Antelope Lake.      Set the x axis   of   the   cross-代 写ESS 312 – Hydrogeology Assignment 1
代做程序编程语言sectional   flownet   to   the   transect   distance   between   survey   point   A4-T   on   the shoreline of   Antelope lake (as the origin) and survey point   B3-T   on   the   shoreline   of   Beaver Bog.    The y-axis will be mean elevation above sea level;   use   95   masl   at   the   origin      to   140 masl.    Note: you will need to apply an approximate vertical exaggeration   (VE) near   16.5.    Recall that   VE = vertical (i.e., y axis ) scale /   horizontal   (i.e.,   x   axis)   scale.      Indicate      equipotential lines (using   1.0 m hydraulic head spacings), groundwater flow   direction   (arrows), flow/no-flow/constant head boundaries.
5.       Prepare a short (no more than three pages) written   summary that   describes the   nature   of   groundwater flow (i.e., directions and boundaries) in the   study   area; typed using   a   12-point font with double-line spacing.    Point form   is unacceptable.
